 Cheese Straws - OpenEats2 Dev

Chef: michelina
In addition to cheese, you can sprinkle the straws with poppy seeds, sesame seeds, paprika, or cayenne pepper. Once cooled, the straws will keep at room temperature up to one week.

For the most flavorful and crisp results, use best-quality (all-butter) puff pastry, such as Dufour, available at specialty-food stores and some supermarkets.

    serves 28 cook time 15 mintues

Ingredients

    pinch - All-purpose flour, for dusting
    pinch - Coarse salt
    14 ounces - frozen puff pastry, thawed
    1 - large egg lightly beaten
    4 ounces - Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese approx.1 1/2 cups coursely grated

Steps

1. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out pastry dough to a 12-inch square. Use a pastry brush to dust off excess flour; brush some beaten egg over dough until well moistened.

2. Sprinkle bottom half of dough with half the cheese and a pinch of salt. Fold top half of dough over cheese-covered section, and press gently all over dough to seal. Roll out dough again to a 7 1/2-by-12 1/2-inch rectangle. Brush top of dough with more beaten egg. Sprinkle evenly with remaining cheese, and season with salt; press gently on topping to adhere it.

3. Using a pastry wheel or sharp knife, trim edges to form a neat 7-by-12-inch rectangle. Cut dough into 1/4-by-12-inch strips. Twist into spirals, and place about 1/2 inch apart on baking sheets. To prevent straws from straightening out, gently press both ends onto sheets. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 30 minutes (or up to overnight).

4. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Bake, rotating sheets halfway through, until straws are golden brown and cooked through, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven; loosen straws from sheets with a thin spatula and transfer to a wire rack to cool. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Pasta Sauce
Brown beef in large pot such as a dutch oven, using a med.
heat. Drain beef in a colander. Set aside for now.
Cook the chopped oven in the container used for cooking
the beef, using a med. heat - about 5 minutes. Ignore the
slight burning to the bottom of the pan. Pour in the can of
tomatoes. If whole tomatoes are used, break up with a
potato masher. Add tomato sauce, paste, water, wine,
spices and beef. Bring to a boil, then let simmer until
desired thickness of sauce is reached. Stir frequently.
The amount of water may be adjusted if sauce is too thick
at the beginning. The sauce should cook for at least
one half hour.

    1 - steak

Shrimp in Garlic Butter Sauce - OpenEats2 Dev

Chef: ctrudeau

Simple shrimp in butter garlic sauce



Prefer to use extra large, 20 to a bag pre-cooked frozen shrimp.

    serves 2 cook time 15 mintues

Ingredients

    4 tbsp - Butter
    3 - Garlic
    4 tbsp - Lemon juice
    1 lbs - Shrimp

Steps

Crush/chop 3-4 cloves of garlic. Do not slice (doesn't melt into sauce enough).



Put 1 tablespoon of butter (unsalted) into a frying pan and fry the garlic. Once the garlic is brown, proceed.



If shrimp is not pre-cooked:

    fry shrimp in the butter and garlic
    Once shrimp is cooked, proceed below

If shrimp is pre-cooked:

    Add shrimp, rest of butter to pan. Fry for about 5 minutes
    (Optional) Add lemon juice
    Spice with pepper, parsely, Herbs de Provence or whatever else you like



Preparation Notes:

    Defrost shrimp by soaking in cold water for 30 minutes

Variation Notes:

    Possibly experiment with only 3 tbsp of butter
    Need a lot of parsely if coating in pan, most of it ends up remaining in the sauce
    Instead of "dry plating", serve shrimp with the butter sauch in own shallow bowl
    Last preparation used 2 cloves garlic, very thinly sliced, didn't work well, garlic didn't melt enough, switch back to crushing and dicing
