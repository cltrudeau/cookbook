        </tr>
      
    </table>
  
  

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <div class="steps-box">
    <p>Put the flour into a bowl, making a bowl shaped indent in the middle.</p>
<p>Break the eggs and put them into the indentation in the flour, add oil.</p>
<p>Knead dough together, occasionally adding about an ounce of water to keep it
moist. Once the dough is in a ball, remove it from the bowl and put it on the
counter. Continue to knead the dough until all traces of flour are gone. Keep
adding water a little at a time to keep the dough to the right consitency.
Dough should be moist enough that it doesn't crumble, but not too wet.</p>
<p>Place kneaded dough in a clean bowl, wrap it in a teatowel or put it in a
clean plastic bag. Let it rest for 20 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Fettuccini</strong></p>
<p>Start the pasta machine in roller mode (not cutting into noodles yet) set to
the widest thickness (thickness 1).</p>
<p>Take a handful of dough and put it through the rollers. Fold the flattened
dough in half and put it through the machine again. Repeat this 5-6 times.
Occasionally dust dough with flour to prevent sticking.</p>
<p>Set machine to thickness setting 2, repeat above. Do this for thicknesses 4
and 5 as well. All told the dough will have gone through the machine 4*6=24
times. Resulting pieces should be about 1 foot long and the width of your
pasta machine.</p>
<p>Switch to the fettuccini cutting blades, thickness 5. Cut the pieces of dough
with a knife to their desired length (about 6 inches is typical, half the
length of the result from the previous step). Dust with flour and send it
through the cutting machine.</p>
<p>Separate noddles and leave them to dry a little.</p>
<p>Can be cooked immediately, takes about 5 minutes. Noodles should rise to the
surface of the water when they're ready.</p>
<p>If planning on freezing, use more flour to dust them. Once they've dried a
little, take a few (5-ish) strands and swirl them into a loop about the width of your
hand. Place the loops on a cookie sheet and freeze them. Once frozen, remove
them from the cookie sheet and bag them.</p>
<p><strong>Lasagna</strong></p>
<p>Same dough as above. Set the pasta machine to thickness 1 using the flat
rollers. Put a handful through at a time. Once the dough is passed through the
rollers, fold it in half and repeat. This should be done 5-6 times. Depending
on how long the dough has sat, it may take more repetition.</p>
<p>Change roller thickness to setting 5, repeat 2-3 times.</p>
<p>Change roller thickness to setting 6, repeat 2-3 times. You should be getting
long, wide noodles, typically 20 inches in length. Measure to desired length
of your lasagna tray and cut as needed.</p>
<p>Change roller thickness to setting 7, repeat 1-2 times.</p>
<p>Cook noodles for at most 3 minutes. Noodles should rise to the top of the
water when done.</p>
<p>Drain the noodles and spray them with cold water to stop them from cooking
further.</p>
<p>Assemble rows of noodles, 8-10 layers, layering with sauce and/or cheese on
each layer. Number of layers required will depend on the thickness of your
sauce.</p>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <div class="notes-box">
      <p>Pasta machine roller thickness varies between manufacturers. Your settings may
need to be different.</p>
<p>Costanza's machine:</p>
<ul>
<li>fettuccini thickness: 5</li>
<li>lasagna thickness: 7</li>
</ul>
<p>Michelina's machine:</p>
<ul>
<li>fettuccini thickness: 2-3 (guessing based on lasagna attempt)</li>
<li>lasagna thickness Trudeau style: 4 (confirmed from trying)</li>
<li>lasagna thickness DiNunno style: 6 (guessing, want thinner as more noodles)</li>
</ul>
